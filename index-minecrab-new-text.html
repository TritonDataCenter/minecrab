        <p>Minecrab aims to solve the problems around Minecraft server hosting by creating a reasonably priced, high-performance, accessible and dynamic cloud environment.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Eliminate the expense of leaving your Minecraft servers running when no one is playing.</li>
          <li>Friends having a difficult time knowing where to connect.</li>
          <li>Minecraft server software updates.</li>
          <li>Keeping a backup of your world, either as a save point or as protection from server crashing.</li>
          <li>Migrating your world to bigger servers if server resources become exhausted.</li>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <div class="col-lg-6 how-it-works-section-left">
        <p>The Minecrab software is a <a href="">set of command line tools</a>
          that run on your local computer along with a set of management scripts
          that run on a remote, virtual server. For example,
          the <span style="command">minecrab-launch</span> command will launch a
          virtual computer on <a href="">Joyent’s cloud</a> and set it to
          download the latest <b>Minecraft</b>, <b>Feed the Beast
          Ultimate</b>, <b>Bukkit</b> or
          <b>Voltz</b> server, install it, and start it up.</p>
        <p>The first time your server starts it will generate a new world. You
          can then whitelist those that you want to play with, and send them a
          link to your personal Minecrab Status Page, where they can discover
          server status and connection information.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 how-it-works-section-right">
        <p>At any time you can issue a command to backup your server data to
          Joyent’s Manta or kick off a job to <b>generate a Google-maps style
          overview of your world</b>. If maps are generated, a thumbnail will show
          up on your Minecrab Status Page.</p>
        <p>When you’re done playing and issue the shutdown command, Minecrab
          will <b>automatically backup your world data</b>, kick off a job to
          regenerate the map and shut the server down. When you’re ready to play
          again, use the same launch command you used originally and your world
          will <b>be restored where you left off!</b></p>

    <div class="how-much-does-it-cost-section">
      <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
      <div class="how-much-does-it-cost-left">
	<p>Minecrab currently launches a virtual server with 4 GB of RAM, 131 GB
	  of disk space and 1 virtual CPU. This costs about $0.13 per hour per
	  running server.</p>
	<p>Once you backup your world, there's storage cost at a rate of about
	  $0.09 per GB per month. Most worlds are less than 100 MB.</p>
	<p>Hosting and generating maps is actually the most expensive part of
	  Minecrab. New worlds take about 5 minutes to render. Large maps can take
	  hours. Time spent generating the world is billed at about $0.58 per hour
	  and the resulting Manta storage can end up in multi-GB range for a
	  medium-size world.</p>
	<p>Note that this doesn't take into account the bandwidth charges for
	  accessing your maps or server status page, though the first GB of
	  bandwidth out of Manta is free and then up to 10 TB is only $0.12 per
	  GB, so unless viewing your world goes viral, it shouldn't factor into
	  the cost.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="how-much-does-it-cost-right">
	<p>As an example, say that you have a single, medium size world that you
	keep running for one night a week for about 3 hours). You only generate
	the map once at the end of the month. Here's the approximate cost
	breakdown:</p>

	<p class="cost-breakdown">
World backup storage, 50 MB:   $0.09 x 0.05 GB    < $0.01
Server running time:           $0.13 x 15 hours     $1.95
World map rendering time:      $0.58 x 2 hours      $1.16
Map storage, 2 GB:             $0.09 x 2 GB         $0.18
----------------------------   ----------------
Total:                                              $3.30
	</p>

	<p>Even with map generation, this is still significantly cheaper than a
	  dedicated 24x7 Minecraft server hosting elsewhere. And if you want to
	  live without a map, it'll cost you less than a $1.00 a month per
	  Minecraft server!</p>
