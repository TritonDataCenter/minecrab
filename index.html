<p>Only the independently wealthy can live the dream of playing Minecraft with
their friends all day, every day.  For the rest of us, there's Minecrab!
Minecrab aims to solve the problems around Minecraft server hosting, including
(but not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>The expense of leaving your Minecraft servers running when no one is playing.</li>
<li>Friends having a difficult time knowing where to connect.</li>
<li>Minecraft server software updates.</li>
<li>Keeping a backup of your world, either as a save point or as protection from
server crashing.</li>
<li>Migrating your world to bigger servers if server resources become exhausted.</li>
<li>Sharing your Minecraft creations with your family and friends.</li>
</ul><p>That sounds magical.  How does it work?</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h2>

<p>The Minecrab software is a set of command line tools that run on your local
computer along with a set of management scripts that run on a remote, virtual
server.  For example, the <code>minecrab-launch</code> command will launch a virtual
computer on Joyent's cloud and set it to download the latest Minecraft, Feed the
Beast Ultimate, Bukkit or Voltz server, install it, and start it up.  The first
time your server starts it will generate a new world.  You can then whitelist
those that you want to play with, and send them a link to your personal Minecrab
Status Page, where they can discover server status and connection information.
At any time you can issue a command to backup your server data to Joyent's Manta
or kick off a job to generate a Google-maps style overview of your world.  If
maps are generated, a thumbnail will show up on your Minecrab Status Page.  When
you're done playing and issue the shutdown command, Minecrab will automatically
backup your world data, kick off a job to regenerate the map and shut the server
down.  When you're ready to play again, use the same launch command you used
originally and your world will be restored where you left off!</p>

<p>What do your friends see?</p>

<p>TODO: Add screenshot.</p>

<p>What does that actually look like from the command line?  Here we already have a
server that's offline, named "salt":</p>

<pre><code>#Most of the command output redacted for clarity...

<a name="how-much-does-it-cost" class="anchor" href="#how-much-does-it-cost"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How much does it cost?</h2>

<p>Minecrab currently launches a virtual server with 4 GB of RAM, 131 GB of disk
space and 1 virtual CPU.  This costs about $0.13 per hour per running server.</p>

<p>Once you backup your world, there's storage cost at a rate of about $0.09 per
GB per month.  Most worlds are less than 100 MB.</p>

<p>Hosting and generating maps is actually the most expensive part of Minecrab.
New worlds take about 5 minutes to render.  Large maps can take hours.  Time
spent generating the world is billed at about $0.58 per hour and the resulting
Manta storage can end up in multi-GB range for a medium-size world.</p>

<p>As an example, say that you have a single, medium size world that you keep
running for one night a week for about 3 hours).  You only generate the map once
at the end of the month.  Here's the <em>approximate</em> cost breakdown:</p>

<pre><code>
World backup storage, 50 MB:   $0.09 x 0.05 GB    &lt; $0.01
Server running time:           $0.13 x 15 hours     $1.95
World map rendering time:      $0.58 x 2 hours      $1.16
Map storage, 2 GB:             $0.09 x 2 GB         $0.18
-------------------------      -----------------
Total:                                              $3.30
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this doesn't take into account the bandwidth charges for accessing
your maps or server status page, though the first GB of bandwidth out of Manta
is free and then up to 10 TB is only $0.12 per GB, so unless viewing your world
goes viral, it shouldn't factor into the cost.</p>

<p>Even with map generation, this is still significantly cheaper than a dedicated
24x7 Minecraft server hosting elsewhere.  And if you want to live without a map,
it'll cost you about $2.00 a month!</p>
