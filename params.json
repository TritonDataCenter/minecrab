{"name":"Minecrab","tagline":"Minecraft on Joyent's Cloud & Manta on Demand","body":"## What is Minecrab?\r\n\r\nOnly the independently wealthy can live the dream of playing Minecraft with\r\ntheir friends all day, every day.  For the rest of us, there's Minecrab!\r\nMinecrab aims to solve the problems around Minecraft server hosting, including\r\n(but not limited to):\r\n\r\n* The expense of leaving your Minecraft servers running when no one is playing.\r\n* Friends having a difficult time knowing where to connect.\r\n* Minecraft server software updates.\r\n* Keeping a backup of your world, either as a save point or as protection from\r\nserver crashing.\r\n* Migrating your world to bigger servers if server resources become exhausted.\r\n* Sharing your Minecraft creations with your family and friends.\r\n\r\nThat sounds magical.  How does it work?\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nThe Minecrab software is a set of command line tools that run on your local\r\ncomputer along with a set of management scripts that run on a remote, virtual\r\nserver.  For example, the `minecrab-launch` command will launch a virtual\r\ncomputer on Joyent's cloud and set it to download the latest Minecraft, Feed the\r\nBeast Ultimate, Bukkit or Voltz server, install it, and start it up.  The first\r\ntime your server starts it will generate a new world.  You can then whitelist\r\nthose that you want to play with, and send them a link to your personal Minecrab\r\nStatus Page, where they can discover server status and connection information.\r\nAt any time you can issue a command to backup your server data to Joyent's Manta\r\nor kick off a job to generate a Google-maps style overview of your world.  If\r\nmaps are generated, a thumbnail will show up on your Minecrab Status Page.  When\r\nyou're done playing and issue the shutdown command, Minecrab will automatically\r\nbackup your world data, kick off a job to regenerate the map and shut the server\r\ndown.  When you're ready to play again, use the same launch command you used\r\noriginally and your world will be restored where you left off!\r\n\r\nWhat do your friends see?\r\n\r\nTODO: Add screenshot.\r\n\r\nWhat does that actually look like from the command line?  Here we already have a\r\nserver that's offline, named \"salt\":\r\n```\r\n#Most of the command output redacted for clarity...\r\n$ minecrab-list                   # List all online/offline worlds\r\nIP              STATE      NAME\r\nn/a             offline    salt\r\n$ minecrab-launch pepper          # Launch a the server called \"pepper\"\r\nStatus Website: https://us-east.manta.joyent.com/Joyent_Dev/public/minecrab/index.html\r\n$ minecrab-list                   # List all online/offline worlds\r\nIP              STATE      NAME\r\n165.225.149.134 running    pepper\r\nn/a             offline    salt\r\n$ minecrab-add-friend pepper bob  # Allow bob to play on pepper\r\n$ minecrab-backup pepper          # Backup your server data to Manta\r\n$ minecrab-map pepper             # Kick off a job to generate a map\r\n$ minecrab-shutdown -M pepper     # Backup and shut down, but don't map\r\n$ minecrab-list                   # List all online/offline worlds\r\nIP              STATE      NAME\r\nn/a             offline    pepper\r\nn/a             offline    salt\r\n$ minecrab-launch pepper          # Restore\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How much does it cost?\r\n\r\nMinecrab currently launches a virtual server with 4 GB of RAM, 131 GB of disk\r\nspace and 1 virtual CPU.  This costs about $0.13 per hour per running server.\r\n\r\nOnce you backup your world, there's storage cost at a rate of about $0.09 per\r\nGB per month.  Most worlds are less than 100 MB.\r\n\r\nHosting and generating maps is actually the most expensive part of Minecrab.\r\nNew worlds take about 5 minutes to render.  Large maps can take hours.  Time\r\nspent generating the world is billed at about $0.58 per hour and the resulting\r\nManta storage can end up in multi-GB range for a medium-size world.\r\n\r\nAs an example, say that you have a single, medium size world that you keep\r\nrunning for one night a week for about 3 hours).  You only generate the map once\r\nat the end of the month.  Here's the _approximate_ cost breakdown:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWorld backup storage, 50 MB:   $0.09 x 0.05 GB    < $0.01\r\nServer running for 12 hours:   $0.13 x 15 hours     $0.95\r\nWorld map rendering time:      $0.58 x 2 hours      $1.16\r\nMap storage, 2 GB:             $0.09 x 2 GB         $0.18\r\n----------------------------   ----------------\r\nTotal:                                              $2.30\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this doesn't take into account the bandwidth charges for accessing\r\nyour maps or server status page, though the first GB of bandwidth out of Manta\r\nis free and then up to 10 TB is only $0.12 per GB, so unless viewing your world\r\ngoes viral, it shouldn't factor into the cost.\r\n\r\nEven with map generation, this is still significantly cheaper than a dedicated\r\n24x7 Minecraft server hosting elsewhere.  And if you want to live without a map,\r\nit'll cost you less than a $1.00 a month per Minecraft server!\r\n\r\n## Wow.
